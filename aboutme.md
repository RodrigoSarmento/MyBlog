### My story

I am a fourth-year student of computer engineering at UFRN Brazil With three years of experience in computer vision and robotics as a researcher at UFRN (Brazil).
Since I always have been interested in mobile apps I started to study and currently, I have upload at Play Store an engineering app for students. Now I have started a new mobile project.

As a researcher I was able to develop software, doing research, experiments evaluations, and teach. My skills in this area include: OpenCV, ROS, SLAM, Aruco, Python, C++, Cmake, Ubuntu. I have three papers accepted in different symposiums(LARS IEEE, WVC, EPOCA) and an open research of an autonomous robot That works with lidar and aruco markers.
