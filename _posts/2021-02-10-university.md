This is going to be a recap for me and an advice for any student.

When I enter the university I was still not sure what to do, I was doing C&T(Graduation in Science and Technology) and programming was really not my thing until I had one programming discipline with a teacher that changed my life and made me like programming, it was really a turnover. I was so enthusiastic that I wanted to be part of his research group, then I decided to stands out, studying a lot until I became the best student in the class. at the end of the discipline, we should create a group of three and implement a simple image editor choosing four feature of twelve to implement. I did the project all by myself, doing all the twelve features instead of only the four asked and helping others in the class, I needed to show off if I wanted to ask to be part of the research group.

In the end, we had to show the project and explain our decisions, he looked at my project for one minute and said something like "I know you did all and did it right, so let's not waste any time" and he gave me 10(A+), but I was kind of anxious because I was thinking he could invite me to the research group but he didn't, so I asked if he had any empty room for me and he asks me to join the research group.

From then until today, I have published three papers, done a lot of work in computer vision and robotics participated in robotics tournaments, and learn a lot(still learning, of course). Now we have a work in progress of an autonomous robot, using only a Kinect Camera and the robot odometry, but I'm going to talk more about this later.

Years later, talking to my teacher(now my Advisor), remember when I asked to join the research team, he told me that he didn't realize that I was a great person to join the team until I asked so, so I learned two things from this.

1: If you want to stand out you need to do more than you are asked for.
2: Even you working hard, people may not see your work at first glance, you need to go after the reward.

PS: Thanks, Bruno.
