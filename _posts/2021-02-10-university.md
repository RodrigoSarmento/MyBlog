This is going to be a recap for me and an advice for any student.

When I enter the university I was still not sure what I wanted to do, programming was really not my thing until I had one programming discipline with a teacher that changed my life and made me love to code, it was really a turnover. I was so enthusiastic that I wanted to be part of his research group, then I decided to stands out among the other students, I was always interacting a lot in the classes, teaching the others, and studying a lot. At the end of the discipline, we should create a group of three students and implement a simple image editor, choosing four features of twelve to implement. I did the project all by myself, doing all the twelve features instead of only four asked, I felt I needed to show off if I wanted to be invited to be part of the research group.

In the end, we had to show the project and explain our decisions, he looked at my project for one minute and said something like "I know you did all, so let's not waste any time" and he gave me 10(A+), but what I really wanted was to be invited to the research group, so I asked if he had any empty room for me and he agrees to let me in.

From then until today, I have published three papers, done a lot of work in computer vision and robotics participated in robotics tournaments, and learn a lot(still learning, of course). Now I have a work in progress of an autonomous robot, using only a Kinect Camera and the robot odometry, but I'm going to talk more about this later.

Years later, talking to him(now my Advisor), we were talking about when I asked to join the research team, he told me that he didn't realize that I was indeed a great student and usually he would invite me to join the team, so I learned two things from all of this.

1: If you want to stand out you need to do more than you are asked for.
2: People may not see your effort at first glance, so don't be shy and show your hard work, do not await for the reward to come.

PS: Thanks, Bruno.
