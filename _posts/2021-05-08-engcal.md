# My First Android Project

At University I had the opportunity to see a lot of different areas, such as Data Science, IA, Computer Vision, and so on. But there isn't any subject about mobile, and since I first start coding I had always been curious about Mobile Development. So I had an idea of doing an app that brings together a lot of subjects that we see during Engineering, it was a great opportunity to combine the knowledge I have and it was easier to show to my friends from university.

# What I have learned

So it was my first experience with mobile, and I had to learn UI and UX(Though seeing the app now there is a lot of things I would change).
How the navigate flow works on Android(The app is available only in Android, and uses Java), In-app purchase, integration with Banners, How to publish an App, how to work with assets, fonts, and sizes in different screens and so even more. You can see that there is a lot of steps when you want to publish an App, and I feel really proud to have learned how to do this all by myself.

Before Shown the content of the app I'm going to give credit to two friends that helped me, one is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/t%C3%A1bata-moreira-90997547/">TÃ¡bata</a>, a student of Civil Engineering that helped me a lot with some equations that I didn't remember, and the other is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kaio-ara%C3%BAjo-2461831b1/">Kaio</a> that was the designer, choose the colors, created some assets and so on.

### EngCal

The app is divided into 8 subjects, they are Centroid, Conversions, Crystalline Structure, Hydraulics, Inertia, Installations, Materials, and Beams as you can see in the image below.

  </a>
</div>
<br />

Each Subject can have subdivisions, the divisions can be selected via a hamburger Menu.

  </a>
</div>
<br />

And in some cases, different situations can be chosen via a dropdown.

  </a>
</div>
<br />

All Subjects have an info button with information that can help the user to understand the equation.

  </a>
</div>
<br />

And there is also a gif button that shows the program running.

<br />

    <img src="/MyBlog/assets/img/engcal/gif_hidraulicas.gif" alt="example">
  </a>
</div>
<br />

The user input is pretty straightforward, there are the variables with a text input field, and a button to calculate, of course, there is a lot of error catching if the inputs are wrong.

    <img src="/MyBlog/assets/img/engcal/engcal_error_example.png" alt="example">
  </a>
</div>
<br />

Additionally, I have added banners from MoPub, InApp Purchase(remove banner and donation), and Firebase Analytics.

# Release

After I released the app in PlayStore, a lot of students from my course tested the app and liked it, this was special for me since I have been putting a lot of work into this app, and receiving all the congrat's messages was lovely.

<br />

Because of the people talking about I was asked to give an interview to the <a href="https://www.ect.ufrn.br/egresso-da-ect-desenvolve-aplicativo-mobile/">Course Site</a>
, and right after the University asked to post the interview in the <a href="https://ufrn.br/imprensa/noticias/38574/aplicativo-facilita-visualizacao-de-formulas-e-calculos">University Journal</a>

# What Now?

Now I work with react-native, developing apps for both Android and IOS, and I'm loving everything about it. I'm also developing a text-based game with two friends, but this time I'm using Kotlin to code instead of Java(I should have done this before kkkkkk) and I just don't have time to keep working with this project, I would definitely change a lot of things in the app nowadays, starting from the language, but I'm happy the way it is, I think it was great learning, and I hope that I have inspired some friends to start and finish personal projects.
