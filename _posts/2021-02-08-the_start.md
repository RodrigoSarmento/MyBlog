This is my first post here and as I said in the subtitle I'm not sure what this will become and I believe that what I'm writing now is just for me.

I've always been interested in document my work and tell some histories even for my self in the future, but I've never decided what was the best approach to do so, I tried to take some notes every day in a diary, I tried to use some apps of daily work but none of those seems very useful and I wanted to test something different.

At the start of this year, one of my teachers from the University was talking about the importance of documenting the work, to be used not just as a curriculum but also to training how to teach someone else, training writing, training English (Not my first language) and he gave some examples of ex-students that decided to take this approach and were happy to do so, so here I'm.

I believe I'm going to use this to write three kinds of subjects, that are:

- Update of projects
- Tutorials
- Learnings

I think that's all, I'm already starting to writing the first post about an App I've done for Android.

PS: I was talking this morning with a writer friend of mine about writing, I was talking about how difficult is writing for me, and that he probably writer in one month more than I've ever written in my life, I always have loved reading but I never really wanted to write things until now, I hope it becomes a new thing in my life.

PS2: Since I don't know how to end a text I decided to use PS haha.
